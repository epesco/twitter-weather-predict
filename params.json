  "body": "### Problem Statement\r\nFive hundred million tweets are posted per day via twitter. Twitter is commonly used for sentiment analysis and quantifying influence, but can a tweet be used to predict the weather in a given area? Natural disasters and extreme weather prediction are popular choices for mining twitter data, but few attempts have been made for the day to day weather. This paper explores the possibility of utilizing supervised learning to classify a locationâ€™s weather after training on the lexicon associated with a certain weather type. The methods explored are a naive attempt, naive bayes, positive naive bayes, support vector machines, and ensembling. Within each algorithm, we explore the training, construction and performance of the model. \r\n\r\n### Naive Solution\r\n#### Voting system\r\n\r\nHere is text on our naive solution\r\n\r\n\r\n### Naive Bayes\r\n#### Attempt #1\r\n\r\nHere is text on attempt #1 naive bayes\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\n@msmcconnell\r\n@amjaeger17\r\n@rcjacques\r\n\r\n",
